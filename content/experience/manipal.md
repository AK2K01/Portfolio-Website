### Description

**Guide:** **Prof. Amit Kumar Bairwa** (Professor at Manipal University Jaipur, Rajasthan, India)

Worked on the research project titled "Detection of Malware in Downloaded Files Using Various Machine Learning Models." In this project, the proposed solution is to train different types of machine learning models to differentiate between malicious and benign files.

- Went through several research papers with a domain similar to that of our project work.
- Prepared a very large dataset (over 135000 rows and 50 columns) by extracting and combining data from many different sources. 
- Used various different data preprocessing techniques in order to make the obtained dataset suitable for training the machine learning models.
- Trained over 6 different types of machine learning models for efficiently differentiating between malicious and benign files.
- It was discovered right in the middle of the project that the obatined dataset is imbalanced. This made the models, trained on this dataset to make predictions in favour of a particular class. This problem was resolved with the help of various dataset balancing techniques like: oversampling, undersampling, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), and Balanced Bagging Classifier.
- Enhanced the accuracy of these models using different hyperparameter tuning techniques.
- Arrived at 4 machine learning models with accuracies greater than those obtained by the same models mentioned in the previous works (research papers) of other researchers, in the same problem area.
- In the process of publishing a research paper on this project.
